Module 10 Challenge
Sqlalchemy challenge

This challenge had us performing many tasks we had done using Python and pandas, but this time using a database
as our source data, connecting to it, "reflecting" the database tables into virtual tables and querying
using sqlalchemy.

Here are some of the sources and places I referred to. I had to consult the class exercises a lot, and play around 
a lot.

I found it interesting that after all the sqlalchemy manipulation, to plot the data we put it back in a dataframe like
we did earlier.



Using automap_base to show the classes (database tables)
